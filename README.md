## üìö Description
Once you run the application, it initiates a conversation with you, asking a few questions. It wants to know the text for your logo (up to three characters), the desired color for your text, your choice of a shape (triangle, circle, or square), and the color for that shape.

Based on your responses, the Logo Maker uses object-oriented programming to generate your logo, using different classes for each shape. The result is saved as an SVG file, which you can easily use across your projects.
